A notable rise in the trade dependence on China is clearly visible also in most Western Balkan countries, which could be related to the growing imports of goods that Chinese companies have been using in the implementation of large infrastructure projects. Balance of payments vulnerabilities can be leveraged by China to impose political pressure on governments to change their foreign policy priorities or give up control over strategic assets.',

However, the regional average masks significant country differences with Czechia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina having seen the biggest increase in Chinese economic influence. The large increase in trade flows from China and the development of a number of large-scale infrastructure and energy projects have made these countries more vulnerable than others in the region. ',

            description: 'The lignite-fired Stanari thermal power plant, valuated at USD 674 million, is a typical case for state capture by oligarchic networks of domestic and Chinese companies that have secured preferential treatment from the Republika Srpska entity government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project was developed by the private Energy Financing Team (EFT), controlled by the Serbian businessman Vuk Hamovic with close ties to the ruling Republika Srpska government. But 2/3 of the financing came from the China Development Bank that was guaranteed with a lien on EFT’s concession rights for the exploration of the nearby lignite mine. The entity government of Republika Srpska changed the domestic laws to allow the possibility for the transfer of rights. Furthermore, the government limited the costs for the plant operator by reducing the concession fees for coal power generation from 3.6% to 0.2% of total revenues, while completely exempting it from coal mining fees.',

In 2020, Chinese companies have doubled the amount of EU-based public procurement contracts they have secured to nearly EUR 2 billion (around EUR 3.9 billion in the last decade). A case in point is the construction of the Pelješac bridge in Croatia, whose 85% of the costs were funded with EUR 357 million from the EU Cohesion Funds This represented the first EU tender to be won by a Chinese company. But as with projects funded by non-EU resources there have been again allegations about the presence of anti-competitive practices in the bidding process.',

            description: 'Chinese energy projects appear particularly worrying due to their impact on global warming, air quality and emissions, landscape degradation and biodiversity. A potentially more long-lasting effect of the Chinese investment in CEE countries is what can be described as “a synergy of failures”, which includes the delayed transition to cleaner forms of energy (in particular in Western Balkan countries), non-compliance with European environmental standards, and increased dependency on coal-fired power generation. The unavoidable coal phase-out over the next decade would be delayed with disastrous economic consequences in terms of stranded assets and painful transition for coal-dependent workers. The environmental impact assessment already shows a positive correlation between the Chinese economic influence and an increase in green-house gas emissions but this negative environmental impact is bound to increase in the future as all carbon-intensive projects come online and the effect of the recently-constructed ones kick in.',
